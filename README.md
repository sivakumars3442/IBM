Then, define the server credentials details such as `bucketname`, `endpoint`, `apiKeyId`, and `serviceInstanceId` within the `config/default.json` file found in the `config` folder as the following code snippet.

```

"bucketName": "Files",
"endpoint": "s3.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.cloud",
"apiKeyId": "GMxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxKGX",
"serviceInstanceId": "cxxn:v1:xxxxxxxxx:cloud-object-storage:xxxxxxxx:a/1651281f453343434e69c7fb70f38cd59b9:xxxxxxx-09xxe-xx-xxxx-a85eexxxxxaaf2e::"
